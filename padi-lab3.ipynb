The code uses a random policy to generate trajectories. While a random policy can explore a wide range of beliefs, it may not systematically explore the entire belief space. Some regions of the belief space may be unreachable or unlikely to be visited under a random policy. Moreover, the code ignores beliefs that are too close (distance <\n",
