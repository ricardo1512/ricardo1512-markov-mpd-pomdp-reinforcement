This project includes four computational laboratory assignments carried out in the context of the Planning, Learning, and Intelligent Decision-Making course at Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico in the year 2025, in which various algorithms were implemented:

Lab 1. Markov Chains: description of a phenomenon using a Markov chain and study of its computational properties.

Lab 2. MDPs: description of a decision-making problem using MDPs and solving it through various algorithms.

Lab 3. POMDPs: description of a decision-making problem using POMDPs and solving it through various algorithms.

Lab 4. Reinforcement Learning: solving a decision-making problem using reinforcement learning by implementing and running the appropriate algorithms.
